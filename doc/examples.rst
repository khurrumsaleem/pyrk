Examples
=========

Several examples are present in the [examples 
directory](https://github.com/pyrk/pyrk/tree/master/examples) provided with the 
source code. 

The default and PBFHR examples model the Pebble-Bed Fluoride salt cooled High
temperature Reactor proposed by the University of California, Berkely
(https://fhr.nuc.berkeley.edu/pb-fhr-technology/).

The SFR example models a Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor using data from Ragusa
(Ragusa, Jean C., and Vijay S. Mahadevan. “Consistent and Accurate Schemes for
 Coupled Neutronics Thermal-Hydraulics Reactor Analysis.” Nuclear Engineering
 and Design, vol. 239, no. 3, Mar. 2009, pp. 566–79,
